# Seedrs tech test

A tech test from Seedrs that asked for a backend data model of a mini Seedrs, with data for campaigns and Investments including the use of a database store. Task requirements shown below.

### Requirements

Implement a mini Seedrs with a focus on the backend and data model. It is expected you model your domain, have some classes to perform some actions and have some testing on expected behaviour (for example Rspec or other). 
Campaigns have the following properties

* Campaign name
* Campaign image (this can be a URL sourced by you)
* Percentage raised
* Target Amount
* Sector
* Country
* Investment multiple 
* Re-iterate that you should deliver the backend part of the solution.
* You should implement some sort of data store. E.g. when the code performs an investment that
should be persistent.
* The solution should be implemented on your language / framework of choice.
* You should seed your data with at least 20 campaigns.
* BONUS: Your solution could be be Dockerized - if you go down this route, it is expected that
you include a Dockerfile / docker-compose on your files and clear instructions on how to run it
in a local environment.
* Your solution should include a README file with step by step instructions on how to “run” it.

### Approach

I started by thinking about the object design for this tech test. I imagine it will have a main campaign object that will instantiate with some basic information the user will have to provide like the campaign name, image url, target amount, investment multiple, sector and country and an empty array that will contain all the investment objects that are created. The investment object as the second object which i would inject into the initialize method.

You can view my initial tested object model [here](https://github.com/Lucx14/seedrs-object-model)

Once I had that model in place I started to think about creating a usable back end data model with some database storage. I decided to try to build the model as a Ruby on rails API that would use PostgreSQL as the data store and would be able to feed the backend information as Json via the API endpoints to a frontend developer who could then use those to implement a working front end.



### Usage instructions

You will need to create two PostgreSQL databases on your local machine, table names seedrs_development and seedrs_test using the instructions below.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Lucx14/seedrs-rails-api.git
$ cd seedrs-rails-api
$ bundle install
$ rails server
```
Server should now be open on localhost:3000

### Setting up the local databases

I have used psql to connect to a local postgreSQL relational database on my machine. To interact with this program you will need to do the same. Please follow these steps in the terminal

* Connect to psql
* Create the database using the psql command `CREATE DATABASE seedrs_development;`
* Create a test database using psql command `CREATE DATABASE seedrs_test;`

You should then be able to run the rails database comands

```
$ rails db:migrate
$ bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Your local databases should now be formatted correctly for both Dev and test 


### Database model

#### Table name: campaigns

| Column name   |  Data type     |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| id            | int8           |
| campaign_name          | varchar   |
| campaign_image    | varchar      |
| target_amount | numeric(15,2) |
| sector | varchar |
| country | varchar |
| investment_multiple | numeric(15,2) |
| created_at | timestamp |
| updated_at | timestamp |

#### campaigns has a one to many relationship with investments

| Column name   |  Data type     |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| id            | int8           |
| investment_amount          | numeric(15,2)   |
| campaign_id    | int8      |
| created_at | timestamp |
| updated_at | timestamp |
